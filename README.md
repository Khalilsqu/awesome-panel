## Install geopandas on windows

This is only required to be able to explore a small submit of example applications that depend on geopandas.

On Windows you unfortunately have to install the geopandas requirements manually as described in [using-geopandas-windows](https://geoffboeing.com/2014/09/using-geopandas-windows/).
